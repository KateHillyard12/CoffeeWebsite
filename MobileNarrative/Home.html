                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        For my Mobile Narrative, I chose to ask multiple BSU students about their coffee habits.
                        As a college student, coffee is an essential and prominent part of my day-to-day life and I was
                        curious if my peers were the same.
                        College is a very time-demanding career and in most cases, it interferes with sleep management.
                        Did you play too much animal crossing earlier and now it's almost midnight and you have a big
                        assignment due in the morning? Coffee!
                        Now you have to wake up at 7 am to get to class but it's a little cold outside and you're about
                        to face a chilly 20-minute walk? Coffee!
                        But now you are tired after class but have an 8-hour shift ahead? I have a great idea. Coffee!
                        I've discovered that this is an average college student experience, so why not look further into
                        it?
                        Coffee is a worldwide drink that comes in various forms such as lattes, americanos, macchiatos,
                        and many more.
                        The interesting part is all these different types of coffee taste different in almost every
                        place or cafe you go, even if it's the same recipe.
                        Sadly enough you'll never have that one perfectly nutty and dark coffee you got from that one
                        cafe down the street that was served in a rush at 10 am.
                        You can order it again but it'll never taste the same. So where does everyone go and what do
                        they get that drink that's perfectly nutty and dark?
                        And why not ask the professionals, the ones who drink it every day and practilaly breathe it?
                        Coffee and college students simply go perfectly together.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        To collect my data for the narrative I made a quiz on Google Forms. I asked 6 coffee related
                        questions:
                        “Do you drink coffee?”, “Where do you get your coffee?”, “Why do you drink coffee?”,
                        “What drink do you typically get?”, “What time of day do you usually drink your coffee?”
                        and, “On average how many cups of coffee do you drink a day?”. I created a link to these
                        questions and posted them
                        on my Snapchat and Instagram story as well as the “BSU 2025 class” Snapchat story.
                        Collecting the data was fortunately very easy after I attached the form to a spreadsheet to
                        record the responses.
                        After only 6 hours I had received 135 responses. The next day after posting on social media the
                        responses came in
                        very slowly so I decided 135 was enough and removed the quiz from of the sources. To see or take
                        the quiz click on
                        the link attached to "Collecting Data".

                    <p>
                        A couple of conclusions that can be drawn from my data are as follows; the average amount of
                        coffee BSU students drink daily is 1-2,
                        most students drink coffee for caffeine, the most common place BSU students get their coffee is
                        from Starbucks,
                        and the time of day most students drink their coffee is from 9-12 am.
                        To see the exact data I gathered, go to the link attached to the “Conclusions” title.
